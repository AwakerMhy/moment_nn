# Self-organization of nonlinearly coupled neural fluctuations into synergistic population codes

This repo contains the Python implementation for the recurrent moment neural network (MNN) in the paper [Self-organization of nonlinearly coupled neural fluctuations into synergistic population codes](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/35/11/1820/117580/Self-Organization-of-Nonlinearly-Coupled-Neural).

Run the recurrent moment neural network (MNN) through `bump_attractor.py`.

```sh
python bump_attractor.py
```
